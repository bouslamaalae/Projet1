Examples for using OpenCompare API and services

Our project is about OpenCompare & Product Charts. Our Mission is to generate from  a comparison matrix a productCharts, using Java, JavaScript, Json, Html and CSS. The result must be displayed on a web page and usable on any browser and mobile device (cellphones , tablets ... )

At first, we did tests with the ”pcm” available in getting-started on github in order to see how the “pcm” works with java. After That, we have created a json file using java. We have created a JsonExport Class that contains functions that work with any pcm file given in parameter. A pcm file contains the datas of the matrix.  

Our project is based on Client/Server Architecture.

In our web page, we have two parts, the chart and the filters.

We Use NVD3 for the formatting of the chart.  For each product, we can have specific datas by positioning on this product on the graph. We can have many informations for each product and also links and photos. NVD3 has an Apache Licence.

We have used Eclipse, and Notepad++ for this project. To display the matrix, we have used WampServer to launch the project from a browser.


The filter is done in html and permit us to choose one or many properties of a product.
